# About Me 

- Until 2022, I was a professional cellist, composer and teacher
- I recently completed a 12 week software engineering course with Digital Futures, and am now preparing to take the Oracle Certified Foundations Associate, Java certificate exam.
- My aim is to emerge as a well rounded software engineer with a solid grasp of design principals, methodologies, and the ability to write beautiful, elegant code. 
- Always happy to take feedback and advice from those further along on their tech journey.
- As a cellist and composer, I'm also interested in music-oriented applications ðŸŽµ

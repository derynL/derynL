# About Me 
- Iâ€™m interested in front end and full stack development  
- Until recently, I was a professional cellist, composer and teacher
- Iâ€™m currently on a 12 week software engineering course with Digital Futures  
- I'm hoping to absorb as much as I possibly can during this time, so that I can emerge as a well rounded software engineer with a solid grasp of design principals, methodologies, and the ability to write beautiful, elegant code. Always happy to take feedback and advice from those further along on their tech journey. Equally happy to team up with beginners like myself - we can always learn from each other.
- As a cellist and composer, I'm also interested in music-oriented applications ðŸŽµ
